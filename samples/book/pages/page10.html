Words are not enough to express my gratitide for what both of you 
have done for me. But with whatever words I can think of, I wish to
express my feelings of thankfulness because by the time you are reading
this you might already be far from me headed back to your home.

But this is only a physical seperation, you both will forever be in
my heart and my memories. I would like to thank the Lord for sending
both of you to our lives to share His love. Both of you loved, cared,
supported, helped and taught us. Thank you very much for all those 
things from the depth of my heart.
