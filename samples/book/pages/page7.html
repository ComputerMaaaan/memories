Anyways, back to topic. Firstly, thank you and congratulations to Brother
and Sister Neff for having served such a wonderful mission.
It feels like yesterday that we met and I was jabbering about
all my interest in the computer stuff.  <br><br>
Although we did not spend much time togeather especially because of
all my other stuffs which led to me missing the church a lot, whatever 
time we spent was really fun.
