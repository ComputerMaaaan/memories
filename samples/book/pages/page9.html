	Even the small and fun chats that had while returning home. 
	The computer that we worked on. The programming advices that 
	Brother Neff gave me. The fun little gatherings 
	we had in our home. They will forever be a part of my memory.<br>

<p>
	There is a saying in Nepali that, "The hero always comes at the 
	end". So at last I will say that me and my tummy shall forever 
	miss those cookies that you made for us. <br>

<p>
	I am greatful for every thing that you did for me and my family.
	You were truly a blessing for us. If am able to come to BYU for 
	studies or if I change my plans I will definitely try my best to 
	inform you.
