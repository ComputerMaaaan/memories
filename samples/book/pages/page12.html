<h1>Rachana</h1>

<p>
Thank you to both of you, for the selfless service and love that you
have given us. You both were the proof for me that God is true and
he loves us. I truly believe that it was god himself that sent you 
to us. Is is said that there is always someone waiting for you, waiting
for you to become their reason and cause of happiness. I think it was
the same for us as you became the reason for our happiness.

    Every time you came to our house it made me very happy. I felt 
    very bleessed to be able to welcome you and serve you as well. 
    I always felt that you were the representation of everything that we 
    learned in the scriptures.
